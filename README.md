# ProjectNeuroForge
 A text-based C++ brain training program

Includes minigames to hone different skills:
- TrajectoryTrace: working memory and path prediction
   * A map with randomly placed mirrors appears for a few seconds, then disappears
   * A photon is shown entering the map at a random position
   * User predicts where it will exit after bouncing off the mirrors
   * Correct path is shown
